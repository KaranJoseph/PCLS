Demand Forecasting and Inventory Management for Caterpillar inc.

The company has launched new products in the excavator’s product category in the year 2017 for the Indian Market. The production plan of the company is based on the directives of headquarters based in the USA. The higher management also seeks expert opinions to prepare monthly production plans. 

We received the production data from the company’s ERP system for these newly launched excavators. These products have variable demand, and the company is facing the issue of inaccurate forecasting which has eventually led to deteriorating supplier relationships, inefficient cash flow management, and conflicts withing the company’s departments. The inaccurate forecasting has also resulted in an undersupply and oversupply of inventory due to which the company is also incurring high inventory holding costs and shortage costs.
